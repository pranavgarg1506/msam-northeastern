    "Read through M. Kozdron's paper on diffusion and the heat equation http://stat.math.uregina.ca/~kozdron/Research/UgradTalks/BM_and_Heat/heat_and_BM.pdf. By the 20'th century, heat was partially accepted to be governed by the random motion of particles elastically bumping into each other, with temperature being directly proportional to the particles velocity. **Diffusion** is a model of particle movement where we assume that the motion of particles are governed by a random process, that is for any time step $\\Delta t$, the particle can be modeled as taking a \"step\" of some length in a random direct. We assume that molecules in a still gas or liquid move through a medium by diffusion, like dye spreading outwards through water. \n",
